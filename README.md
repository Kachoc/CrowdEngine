# CrowdEngine
A real-time 3D rendering engine that I developed as a high-school student, at a
time when I was especially fond of computer graphics. 3D graphics is actually
the reason why I discovered computer programming in the first place, because
while using tools like [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) I got curious about
how such programs worked, and decided to learn.

I tried to design things a bit seriously, so I split the project between the
[engine library](CrowdEngine) and a [running application](RunApp) which loads
the library. Of course, implementing a full real-time engine is a tremendous
task, and after a lot of work and 10k LOC down the road I had managed to get a
lot of useful features, like scene managers, a mathematics library, an
extensible pipeline divided in render passes, a light manager, a plugin for
Maya, several shader instances, a noise generator, etc. However, I had to stop
working on it the moment it started to become really interesting, because I
started studying for my bachelor and didn't have time for side project.

Still, working on this engine proved very fun and I learnt (really) a lot while
doing so, both by implementing the engine and reading computer graphics papers,
tutorials and blogs. The passion I grew for computer science at the time
definitely influenced me later one when I had to choose my specialty while a
student at *Ã‰cole polytechnique*.
